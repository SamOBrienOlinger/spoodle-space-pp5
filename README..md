# SpoodleSpace



**[SpoodleSpace](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com)** was developed and submmitted as my fifth Profile Portfolio Project as part of the Advanced Frontend specialization for Code Institute's Diploma in full-stack software development. 

This project introduces a new range of features and funcionalities that offer Users a valuable expansion on my fourth Profile Portfolio Project, **[Cockapoo Club](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com)**, a website used by a fictional online community of dog owners, specifically owners of a breed called 'Cockapoos' (a Cocker Spaniel-Poodle cross) sometimes reffered to as 'Spoodles' (combining the words 'Spaniel' and Poodle').   

Since inital interations based on this original concept, on offer here is a different set of features and functionalities which have evolved into a significantly more immersive, interactive and fuller experience for users.

    - The [README template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template) provided by Code Institute was very helpful as a model for developing this README file.  

    - My mentors, [Naoise Gaffney]() and [Antonio Rodriguez](), were great support and I learned a lot from them throughout the development of this project. 
    
    - The following Code Institute Alumni and students helped guide me and to tease out a range of issues I faced developing the project:
