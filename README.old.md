# spoodle-space-pp5



**[SpoodleSpace](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com)** was developed and submmitted as my fifth Profile Portfolio Project as part of the Advanced Frontend specialization for Code Institute's Diploma in full-stack software development. 

This project introduces a new range of features and funcionalities that offer Users a valuable expansion on my first Profile Portfolio Project, which centred on a fictional webiste for an online community of dog owners called 'Cockapoo Club'. The progress made in this iteration of the original concept includes the addition of Django, CRUD functionality, as well as other new features that evolved out of ideas for delivering signifcant improvements and a fuller experience for Users of this website.
