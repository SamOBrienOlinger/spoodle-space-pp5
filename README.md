# **SpoodleSpace - Frontend**


**[SpoodleSpace](https://spoodle-space-pp5.herokuapp.com/)** was developed and submitted as my fifth Profile Portfolio Project as part of the Advanced Frontend specialization for Code Institute's Diploma in full-stack software development. 

# ![**SpoodleSPACE**](src/assets/README.md-postpage.jpg)

This project introduces a new range of features and functionalities that offer Users a valuable expansion on my fourth Profile Portfolio Project, **[Cockapoo Club](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com)**, a website used by a fictional online community of dog owners, specifically owners of a breed called 'Cockapoos' (a Cocker Spaniel-Poodle cross) sometimes referred to as 'Spoodles' (combining the words 'Spaniel' and Poodle').   

Since initial iterations based on this original concept, on offer here is a different set of features and functionalities which have evolved into a significantly more immersive, interactive and fuller experience for users. The added value of this project is rooted in offering users the only social media platform of its kind, as far as I am aware, that is tailored specifically for  all Cockapoo owners around the world. 

This platform is intended to not only meet the demand for learning and interacting in a fun way from others who share the experience of having Cockapoos in their lives, but also to increase that demand. This platform provides a rare opportunity to establish and develop their own very unique online community.

  ## **[UX and UI Design](#ux-and-ui-design)**

   ### **UX Design**

   Each stage of the UX design process involved revisiting the purpose of the product and reflecting on the goals of every User Story. 

   - Early-Stage Mock-Ups 

     ![Early Stage Mock Up 1](src/assets/README-early-stage-ux-design.jfif)

     ![Early Stage Mock Up 2](src/assets/README-early-stage-design-ux.jfif)

     ![Early Stage Mock Up 3](src/assets/README-early-stage-design-ux-logo.jfif)

        As the above image of ideas for logos demonstrates, SpoodleSpace is self-aware of it's simple and 'old fashioned' feel, but from the early stages of development, providing a more 'basic' UX was considered a positive attribute. At the very beginning, there was almost no consideration given to developing a product that combined the themes of post-nostalgia and post-retro that might result in a UX designed to be ‚Äúso bad, it‚Äôs good‚Äù. 
        
        A significant amount of the added value this platform offers Users is rooted in how it references older versions of current and obsolete platforms. 
        
        In later stages of development, it became clearer that the platform could also be interpreted as a parody of contemporary social platforms combining UI and UX for positive effect.

  ### **UI Design**
   
   Given the nature of the project being a social platform, it was paramount that the aesthetic served a range purposes. The main priorities were:

   - **Branding and Consistency**: maintaining a consistent color scheme across the app is intended to make the app easily recognizable and memorable.

   - **Readability and Accessibility**: the decision to use a strong background color to contrast with text aimed to ensure that content is easy to read and accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments.

   - **Feedback and Interactivity**: the standard expectations of today's users around UI had to be considered. This project attempts to use these taken-for-granted expectations to maximise the impact of basic features on the user, such as changing the color of a button when it's hovered over or clicked.
Often, websites opt for more subtle and subdued shifts between colors to notify users of any data changes happening and to provide real-time feedback to users. SpoodleSapce uses both subtle color themes familiar to users and then loud unexpected strong contrasting colors to achieve a more intense and enhanced UI depending on the context. 

   - **Consistency Across Components**: the styling defined in each of the separate CSS modules reuses a color scheme that can be efficiently applied to the different components as needed, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

   **Color Scheme**

   There are a total of 13 different colors used throughout the project: 

  - `#f8f8f8`
  - `#e9ebf2`
  - `#7112ee`
  - `#ffffff`
  - `#dadadf`
  - `#7177a1`
  - `#7112FB2`
  - `#242a3d`
  - `#3b3d24`
  - `#cfced3`
  - `#7112ee`
  - `#7112FB2`
  - `#242a3d`


These colors are used for background colors, text colors, and border colors.

  ![colors](/src/assets/readme_colors.jpg)

   Following on from the points made about the importance of UI for this project, the most frequently used colors are:

   - **Background Colors:**
     - `#f8f8f8`
     - `#ffffff`
     - `#f1f1f1`

   - **Text Colors:**
     - `#e9ebf2`
     - `#7112ee`
     - `#7177a1` 

 There are three features most directly connected to the core concept of the website and to the three custom models in the backend. The styling for each can be found in these files: 

 - DogProfile.module.css
 - DogHealth.module.css
 - DogDanger.module.css 

For UX and UI reasons outlined above, it was important that they shared the same color scheme and overall styling. 
The shared Styles for DogProfile, DogHealth, and DogDanger modules are:

- Background Color: `#ffffff`
- Border Color: `#dadadf`
- Border Radius: `2px`
- Margin Bottom: `16px`
- Text Alignment: `center`

To provide real-time feedback to Users notifying them of any changes they make to their data I used React's ['Notification Container' component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-notifications).

The front-end library chosen for the project was [React Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) to combine the component-based approach of React with the styling and design principles of Bootstrap. The advantage of this decision was directly linked to the tight timeframe for delivering a MVP. Its 'out of the box' components and pre-built styles removed a significant amount of the time and energy required. Other advantages of its key features for this project include:

- React Components: It provides React-compatible versions of Bootstrap components, allowing developers to use them in their React applications seamlessly.

- Responsive Design: React Bootstrap components are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

- Customization: While React Bootstrap provides ready-to-use components, developers can still customize and extend these components to meet the specific requirements of their applications.

- Integration: React Bootstrap can be easily integrated into existing React projects. Developers can import individual components or the entire library based on their needs.

- Maintained and Updated: React Bootstrap is actively maintained and updated to align with the latest versions of React and Bootstrap.

### [**Agile Development Process**](#agile-development-process)

  - Github Projects was used to structure the workflow. 
  - View the Project on Github [**Here**](https://github.com/users/SamOBrienOlinger/projects/3)
    
To achieve the site goals outlined in the User Stories section above, the development process was divided into sprints with three categories using the MoSCoW method. This helped prioritize the implementation of features based on their importance.

- **Must Have**

  - User Authentication: Users can create an account, sign in, and sign out.
  - User Profiles: CRUD functionality for users to personalize their presence on the website through profile pages.
  - Followers Feed: Users can view a list of posts by other users they are following. The logic for this feature can be found in the `utils.js`, `ProfileDataContext.js`, and `ProfilePage.js` files.
  - Liked Feed: Users can view a feed of posts they have liked. This feature is implemented in the `Navbar.js` component.
  - Image Posts: Users can create, read, update, and delete posts with images, titles, and descriptions.
  - Custom Models and Forms: Three custom models and corresponding forms with CRUD functionalities that are relevant to the site goal.
  - README.md files for the frontend and backend repositories.
  - Testing


- **Should Have**

  - Infinite Scroll: Implementing infinite scroll functionality for an improved user experience.
  - Search Bars: Users can search for posts and navigate to pages related to the three custom models and forms.

- **Could Have**

   - Online Resources: A feature that provides users with access to relevant websites and a list of online resources related to the site goal.
   - Portfolio Project 4 Link: A feature that redirects users to my Portfolio Project 4, [Cockapoo Club, Dublin Ireland](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com).

- **Would Have**

    - Add functionality to upload video to posts.

### [**Typography**](#typography)

- The main font-family used throughout the project was "Lato", "Oswald", "DM Sans", "sans-serif". 

- These fonts were chosen to remain consistent with previous projects for [**Features for the future**](#features-for-the-future) when they are connected to each other. 

### [**Main Features**](#main-features)

 - Each of the features and goals for every User Stories outlined in detail above were implemented.

 - The React library provided menu of reusable components that were vital to allowing me using specific element across multiple features on the frontend on the project. These invaluable components saved me an immeasurable amount of time. I either customized or relied heavily on the following to meet the site goal:

    - Assets.js
    - Avatar.js
    - MoreDropDown.js
    - ProfileEditDropdown.js
    - Navbar.js 
    - NotFound.js


    **Asset.js**

    This component can display an image, a spinner, and/or a message to the user depending on the circumstances. It accepts the following props:

    - `spinner`: A boolean indicating whether to display a spinner animation.
    - `src`: The source URL of an image.
    - `message`: A message to display.

    **Avatar.js**

      This component is used to display the user's personalised avatar with an image they are able to choose. It accepts the following props:

      - `src`: The source URL of the avatar image.
      - `height`: The height of the avatar image.
      - `text`: Text to overlay on the avatar.

    **MoreDropdown.js**

      This component represents a dropdown menu with options for the user to edit and delete details as needed. It uses Bootstrap's Dropdown component and accepts two callback functions:

      - `handleEdit`: A callback function for the edit action.
      - `handleDelete`: A callback function for the delete action.

      **ProfileEditDropdown.js**

      Similar to `MoreDropdown`, this component allows the user to use a dropdown menu with options for editing their profile. It accepts the `id` of the profile to determine where to redirect for editing.

      **NavBar.js**

      This component provides navigation links and icons based on whether a user is logged in or not. It includes features such as sign out and dynamic icons based on a user's authentication status.

      **NotFound.js**

      This component is used to display a "Not Found" message along with an image when a user tries to access a non-existent page. It uses the `Asset` component to display the image and message.


### [**Features for the future**](#features-for-the-future)

  Features planned for future implementation are:

  - Connecting **[SpoodleSpace](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com)** with **[Cockapoo Club](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com)** to widen the scope of both products and increase sustained engagement for both.    

  - Functionality for liking and commenting on user's **dog profile**, **dog health details** and their **dog danger details**. 

  - A customised drop down menu component for appropriate fields for some of the models and forms that implements Yes/No options when creating and editing user's **dog profile**, **dog health details** and their **dog danger details**.  

### [**Testing**](#testing)

- **Manual Testing**

    Manual testing of every feature, component and page was conducted on an ongoing basis throughout development. All test cases performed as intended and passed. The most important of these, regarding users being able to Create, Read, Update and Delete data, included:

    - Overlays
    - Tooltips
    - forms 
    - search bars
    - links
    - dropdown menus
    - redirects
    - authentication
    - ownership
    - toggles
    - buttons 
    - uploading images

    A separate file providing details of all the test cases carried out can be found **[here](testing.md)**

  
    The following tools were used to support, test and fix any responsive design issues:

  - [React Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) 
  - [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
  - [Am I Responsive:](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)  

![Responsive Multiscreen image](src/assets/README.md-multiscreen.jpg)

  When testing if the website was responsive or not in order to improve the UI media queries were implemented for the relevant components as follows:

- The DogProfilePage.module.css file uses the same media query as Code Institute's ProfilePage.module.css but uses a more appropriate className. 

  ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 991px) {
      .DogProfileImage {
        width: 250px;
        height: 250px;
  ```


  ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 991px) {
      .ProfileImage {
        width: 250px;
        height: 250px;
      }
    }
  ```
  
- Due to the number of icons and features added to the Navigation bar, in the file NavBar.module.css the media query regarding className '.NabBar' was adapted to the following:

  ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
      .NavBar {
      padding-left: 0rem;
      padding-right: 0rem;
  ```


 - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) were used to enforce consistent code formatting.
